As some Tweetnicy have pointed out, the thumbnail is very poorly selected, or designed. NAFO Fellas are not nearly the epitome of soft-power diplomacy, or diplomacy in general. They are just some agents-saboteurs, and that's about it. I am by far no connoisseur of diplomacy either, because I am sceptical about what I'm saying now, but it is a fait accompli that diplomacy includes negotiating with rogue states and international criminals. But I think that even with regards to this, it is barely an argument to now coerce Ukraine to seek a compromise deal with Russia. Yes, negotiations are necessary and will end this war. But they can only start once Russia is dragged down in a position where Ukraine and they can negotiate tête-à-tête. *That* is non-negotiable, just like Ukraine's victory. I am certain that master diplomats agree with this*.
