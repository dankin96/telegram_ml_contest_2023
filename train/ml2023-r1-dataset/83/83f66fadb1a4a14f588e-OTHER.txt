The efficiency of the code is very low: it requires a full scan of
the bucket index every single day. Depending on the traversal order
(unordered listing helps), this might mean it takes a very long time to
find the items that can be deleted, and even when it gets to them, it's
bound by the deletion time, which is also slow (that the head of the
objects is a synchronous deletion in many cases, while the tails are
async garbage-collected).

Fixing this isn't trivial: either you have to scan the entire bucket, or
you have to maintain a secondary index in insertion-order for EACH
prefix in a lifecycle policy.
