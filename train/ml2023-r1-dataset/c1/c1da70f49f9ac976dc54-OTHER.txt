 Need some advice. I (32F) am engaged to my fiance (36M) and I'm struggling with feeling pressured to spend more time with his family. My family lives 3000km away and we are a small family and not close. We usually just had small family get togethers for holidays and special occasions, like about 4-8 people. My fiance's family is big and close and loving. They are very kind to me and it seems like they all really like me. I like them too, for the most part. I am from the city, they are country people so we definitely clash on some views and politics but they always respect my beliefs and values (for example, I'm vegetarian and they are all meat and potatoes kinda people but they aways try to have a veggie option for me, although it's usually not what I even like or want, but hey, they try). Anyways, they like to gather. When it's someone's birthday, there's usually an event. At these events, there are about 20-30 people there, all close relatives of my fiance. Because there is so many people in his family, we end up gathering as a big group at least twice a month. My fiance's mother also likes to invite us for dinner 1-2 times per week. We live a block away so it's hard to say no. She's a widow and my fiance feels the need to be there for her at her every beck and call, which I can understand, to a degree.
