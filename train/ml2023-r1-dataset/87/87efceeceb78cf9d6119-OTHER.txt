During a mushroom battle, you can press the 'Call for Help' button once a day to ask your friends to join the battle.

Friends who get the call for help will be able to join the battle even if theyâ€™re far away.

All your friends will be sent a call for help. However, if you have a long friends list, friends will be selected randomly.

Join forces with your friends and destroy as many mushrooms as you can!
