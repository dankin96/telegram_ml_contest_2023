Whoever makes a profit today should not be complacent, and whoever suffers a loss should not be disappointed. Don't worry about the initial loss, as long as you stick to the end according to the instructor's instructions, the loss will be reduced in the next period of time, and you will gain greater profits in a short period of time. Thank you for your cooperation today.
