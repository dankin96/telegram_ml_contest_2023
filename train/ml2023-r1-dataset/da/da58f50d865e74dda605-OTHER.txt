South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has issued a warning that North Korea is targeting its shipbuilding sector. The attacks, which began in August and September, involve phishing emails sent to maritime industry employees and IT contractors. Clicking on these emails deploys malicious code. The NIS believes that these attacks are likely being directed by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who is seeking intelligence to help his Navy build medium to large ships. The NIS has alerted the relevant companies and expects the attacks to continue. In related news, South Korean and US authorities are monitoring North Korea to determine if it has halted nuclear reactor operations at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. There are signs that electricity production has stopped, which may indicate North Korea's attempt to recover plutonium for weapons.
