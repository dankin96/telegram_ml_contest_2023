  Good question! The words "sit" and "seat" are often confused because they sound similar and have related meanings, but they are not exactly interchangeable. Here's the main difference:
* "Sit" is a verb that means to be in a position of sitting, either on a chair or on the ground. For example: "Please sit down."
* "Seat" is a noun that refers to the place where someone sits, such as a chair or a couch. For example: "The seat of the chair was uncomfortable."
So, if you're talking about the physical place where someone sits, use "seat". If you're talking about the action of sitting, use "sit". Does that help clarify things?
