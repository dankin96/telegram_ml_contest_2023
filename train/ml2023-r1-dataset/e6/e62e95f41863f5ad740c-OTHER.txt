there were a lot more incidents but these made me most upset. yesterday at about 7:45 pm (19:45) i finally brought up the issue with her saying “i’m getting real sick and tired of you being late to everything. when you’re late to stuff when it’s just us it doesn’t make me as upset. but when you’re late to something my mom invites you too i take offense because i find that rude. i’m saying this because i love you and i don’t wanna keep this feeling away from you any longer because i know it’s not fair. but i would appreciate if you could try to be on time to things a lot more”. i really feel like she doesn’t think being late is a big deal because even if it’s not a big deal that’s not really the point in my eyes. but i sent that text hoping we could have a conversation about the issue, but it’s been 24 hours and she has yet to respond to me.
