like I said in this beginning this is definitely not for everyone and the context mention about is those looking to build entrepreneurial career. But like I hope that outside that everyone should want to do big this and the best of their career and with that know that there is no balance but rather sometime sacrifices to be made, in different ways don't married if you can't take care of yourself. Don't have a baby when you are not ready especially if you're the woman. We need more women leaders and sometime delaying to achieve some stability can just help the world get more of you.
