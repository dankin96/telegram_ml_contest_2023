Most bootloaders cannot boot from LVM directly - neither GRUB Legacy nor LILO can. GRUB2 can boot from an LVM linear logical volume, mirrored logical volume and possibly some kinds of RAID logical volumes. No bootloader currently supports thin logical volumes.
For that reason, it is recommended to use a non-LVM /boot partition and mount the LVM root from an initramfs. An initramfs can be generated automatically through Genkernel, Dracut or manually as Custom Initramfs
