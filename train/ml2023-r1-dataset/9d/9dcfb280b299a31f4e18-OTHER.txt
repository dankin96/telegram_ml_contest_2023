Every project is to make money on both sides, starting from there, if you have a small investment like many people, what you have to do is reinvest, that way you will get more out of it. Since the beginning the fee has been 5% or 3 USD, anyone who knows that is ridiculous withdraws as much as you have 4 USD. Assuming you have invested 30 dollars, if it hasn't gone too badly for you, what can happen, it is within % of every game, you should have practically a x2, 60 dollars, if you subtract the 5% which is 3 usdt, you get 57, I think than 30 and get 57 in 30 days... almost a x2, I think it's not bad at all. But nothing happens, depending on the colors, but saying that 3usdt is a fee theft... I don't agree at all.
