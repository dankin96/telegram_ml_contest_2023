 I 20f am pregnant with my first baby and I’m due any day now. My boyfriend(22m) and his parents have strained relationship right now to say the least. His mother is extremely difficult to get along with she is overbearing makes comments that are incredibly inappropriate and is very controlling. One example is the night before our baby shower me and my boyfriend were at my moms house preparing food and getting all the decorations together and she calls him cussing him out and telling him she hates him. She was upset we weren’t at her house putting up the decorations yet and instead of asking us when we were going to be there she did that instead. Every week it’s a different issue that could easily be solved by communicating like adults but it always goes straight to telling my boyfriend what a piece of crap he is how he’s horrible. The latest issue is he finally got his first tattoo and he posted it on his Instagram his brother saw his story and told his mom she called his cussing him telling him that she never wants to see him again that no matter what happens don’t ever call her. This cycle always happens she gets mad and goes off like a lunatic and then expects everyone to just forget everything and be happy again. I’m at a point where I don’t want her around my child because she really seems unstable to me and I can’t trust she won’t go off like that on my baby. My boyfriend is just beyond caring he’s used to her doing this to him and could care less about her. When I mentioned not telling her when the baby is born my mom said that would be petty and to at least tell her and let her be involved with him. I’m caught between thinking I should be the bigger person or not wanting my baby exposed to her.
