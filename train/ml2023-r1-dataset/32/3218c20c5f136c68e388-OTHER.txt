After the protection status S has been revoked and the departure period has expired, the
provisions of Article 18 ff. AIG apply to admission to the labor market. In particular, admission is
also subject to the maximum numbers for third-country nationals set annually by the Federal
Council (Articles 19 and 20 VZAE). With the abolition of protection status S, people are no
longer considered domestic workers, which is why national priority (Art. 21 AIG) and thus
unsuccessful recruitment efforts on the Swiss labor market and in Europe must be demonstrated
when newly admitted. The majority of people currently employed with protected status S also
do not meet the qualification requirements (Art. 23 AIG), as only managers and qualified
specialists can be admitted. This usually requires a university degree or special professional
knowledge.
3.3.3 People who enter the asylum procedure (AsylG)
If it is determined during the asylum procedure that a person concerned does not fulfill refugee
status, it must be checked whether expulsion from Switzerland can be carried out. If executing
the expulsion is not possible, not permissible or unreasonable, the SEM will examine the order
for temporary admission (Art. 50 AsylV 1 in conjunction with Art. 45 AsylG and Art. 83 AIG). If
asylum is not granted and no temporary admission is given, the SEM will order expulsion (Art.
45 AsylG).
Consequently, it should be noted that only a small proportion of people with protection status S
will probably be able to obtain admission to the labor market after their protection status is
revoked. When exercising discretion, the special situation can be taken into account in individual
cases, provided that the above requirements are generally met.
