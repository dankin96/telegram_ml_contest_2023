Cupboard's bare, I'm so hungry
Life ain't fair, give me some money
Macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack

I love, I love, I love, I love
Kraf dinner

Boiling water, I can't wait
It's getting hotter, it feels so great
Macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack

I love, I love, I love, I love
Kraf dinner
