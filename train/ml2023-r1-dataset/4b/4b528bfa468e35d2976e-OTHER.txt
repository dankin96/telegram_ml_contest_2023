Dear Telegram Support Team/To Whom It May Concern, 
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to appeal for the limitation that has been placed on my Telegram account. I have recently encountered a limitation on my account, which restricts my access to certain features. I would like to express my sincere apologies if my actions inadvertently violated Telegram's policies. It was not my intention to cause any disruptions or violate any terms of use.I kindly request that you review my account and the actions that led to the limitation. I assure you that I will adhere to Telegram's guidelines moving forward and will take the necessary steps to prevent any future violations.I greatly value the services provided by Telegram and the connections I have made on the platform. I kindly request that you consider lifting the limitation on my account so that I can continue to use Telegram without restrictions.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
