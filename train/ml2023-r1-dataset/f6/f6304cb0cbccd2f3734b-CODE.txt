# This is a Python script with nested loops
# It prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10

# Define the range of numbers to multiply
start = 1
end = 10

# Loop through the first number from start to end
for i in range(start, end + 1):
    # Loop through the second number from start to end
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
        # Calculate the product of i and j
        product = i * j
        # Print the product in a formatted way
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {product}")
    # Print a blank line after each row
    print()
