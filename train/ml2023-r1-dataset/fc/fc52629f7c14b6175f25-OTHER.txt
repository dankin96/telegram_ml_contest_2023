I am not dissatisfied with the performance. But come on, a cell phone purchased in 2022 and that costs â‚¬1,200 should not be left aside by the brand. Even though the N3 already exists. It would be very disappointing on Oppo's part. And I think it has enough software or whatever to be the same as the N3. We will continue waiting.
