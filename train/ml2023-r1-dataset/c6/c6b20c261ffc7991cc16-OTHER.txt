US presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. has promised to end the war the White House is waging against bitcoin. Robert wants to stop the US government's attacks on BTC and cryptocurrency miners, and proposes to issue treasury bonds backed by "stable assets": bitcoins, platinum, gold and silver. In his opinion, these government securities will make the economy more stable and independent from the authorities.
