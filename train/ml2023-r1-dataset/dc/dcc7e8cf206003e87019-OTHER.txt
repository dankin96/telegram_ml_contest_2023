In 2013, a speedrunner of the video game Super Mario 64 using the Nintendo 64 console experienced a glitch that teleported Mario higher up in the "Tick Tock Clock" stage. This has been hypothesized to have been caused by an SEU, flipping the least significant bit of Marioâ€™s height value's most significant byte. Attempts by other players to reproduce the glitch, even using the exact controller inputs to recreate the speedrun identically, have not succeeded. Only after a byte of memory is modified in an emulator could players consistently replicate the glitch.
