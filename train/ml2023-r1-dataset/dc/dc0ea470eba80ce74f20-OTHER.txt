Don't fall, don't fall down that hole again
For you will break more than you can mend
Rise up above the fell haze of red
Laying that deadly nature to rest
Don't fall, don't fall down that hole again
For you will break more than you can mend
Rise up above the fell haze of red
Laying that deadly nature to rest
