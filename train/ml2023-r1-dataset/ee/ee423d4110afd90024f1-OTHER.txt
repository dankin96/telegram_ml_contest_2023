The article discusses a unique approach to using an old tablet as an extra screen, specifically as a terminal. The author shares their experience of repurposing their Kindle Fire tablet as an additional screen for their computer. They explain that instead of using traditional methods like Deskreen or virtual display adapters, they opted to SSH into their computer from an Android SSH client and use a custom program to input characters into the screen session, making it feel like they are typing directly into the tablet. 

However, the author highlights some issues with this approach. Firstly, it requires giving a mobile app access to the entire computer, which may pose security risks. Additionally, finding terminal clients for older devices like iPads can be challenging. The author suggests an alternative approach using technologies like xterm.js and web sockets to display the terminal in a web browser and send characters over a web socket, eliminating the need for GPU/HDMI usage. 

The article provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the SSH server, connecting to it using an SSH client, and using the custom program to input characters into the screen session. The author also mentions potential improvements and debugging advice. They conclude by stating that while their program may not be suitable for widespread use, readers can take the idea and create their own improved solutions.
