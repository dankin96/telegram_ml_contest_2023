By looking at these animal adaptations, inventors began to come up with their own ‘artificial gills’. Now making a crude gill is actually rather easy - more straightforward than you would think. You take a watertight box ... which is made of a material which is permeable to gas, that is, it allows it to pass through, inwards and outwards. You then fill this with air, fix it to the diver’s face and go down underwater. But a crucial factor is that the diver has to keep the water moving, so that water high in oxygen is always in contact with the gill, so he can’t really stay still. And to maximise this contact it’s necessary for your gill to have a big surface area. Different gill designers have addressed this problem in different ways but many choose to use a network or lattice-arrangement of tiny tubes as part of their artificial gills. Then the diver is able to breathe in and out - oxygen from the water passes through the outer walls of the gill and carbon-dioxide is expelled. In a nut-shell, that’s how the artificial gill works.
