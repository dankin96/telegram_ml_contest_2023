In my experience, in the 70s in the UK, when no one had even seen a real vanilla pod, or tasted real vanilla flavour, vanilla-flavoured products, notably ice cream were pretty much considered unflavoured, the very basic product. It was therefore considered the boring option, with no frills (even flavour).
