ote The memory pointed to by the returned values is owned by the
 * database. The caller MUST not dispose of the memory, and MUST not modify it
 * in any way regardless in a read-only nor read-write transactions!
 * For case a database opened without the \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP modification
 * attempts likely will cause a `SIGSEGV`. However, when a database opened with
 * the \ref MDBX_WRITEMAP or in case values returned inside read-write
 * transaction are located on a "dirty" (modified and pending to commit) pages,
 * such modification will silently accepted and likely will lead to DB and/or
 * data corruption.
