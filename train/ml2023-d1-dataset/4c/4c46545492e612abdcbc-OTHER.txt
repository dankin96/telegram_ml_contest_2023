1. May i know the procedure for participation? - I can answer this, just RSVP via Meetup 
2. Who will bear the cost of speaker and hospitality? - we Don pay the speakers, they come voluntarily. We only need access to or need to know the nearest canteen for food, snacks etc so that takes care of hospitality 
3. Who will issue the certificate of participation? - we don't do that for Meetups usually since those are smaller events, we could try to generate if it really is required
