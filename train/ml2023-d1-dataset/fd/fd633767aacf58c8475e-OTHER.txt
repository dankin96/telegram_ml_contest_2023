Thanks @Jiricepelka for this write-up! It would be awesome to have shielded recipients in the SNIP-20 standard. I agree with @Avret that this doesn’t help against a spicy print attack, but these things are orthogonal IMO and can be addressed with different solutions. I see this as a way to protect the recipient’s address from the sender, and ORAM as a way to protect against a spicy print attack.
