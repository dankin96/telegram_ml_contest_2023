ProbabilisticScorer's internal models have been substantially improved,
including better decaying (#1789), a more granular historical channel
liquidity tracker (#2176) and a now-default option to make our estimate for a
channel's current liquidity nonlinear in the channel's capacity (#2547). In
total, these changes should result in improved payment success rates at the
cost of slightly worse routefinding performance.
