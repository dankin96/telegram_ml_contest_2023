Shadow PC, a cloud gaming service, has suffered a data breach that exposed the private information of over 500,000 customers. The breach occurred as a result of a social engineering attack targeting one of Shadow's employees. The attacker downloaded malware disguised as a game, which allowed them to steal an authentication cookie and gain access to the company's SaaS provider. The stolen data includes customers' full names, email addresses, dates of birth, billing addresses, and credit card expiration dates. However, account passwords and sensitive payment/banking data were not compromised. Shadow has revoked the stolen authentication cookie and implemented additional security measures to prevent future incidents. A threat actor claiming responsibility for the breach is selling the stolen database on a hacking forum, including IP connection logs. Shadow has not made an official statement regarding the incident. Impacted customers are advised to remain vigilant for phishing attempts and enable multi-factor authentication on their accounts.
