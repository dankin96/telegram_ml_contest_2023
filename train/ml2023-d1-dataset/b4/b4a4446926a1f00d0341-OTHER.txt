 [cracku] The four sentences (labelled 1,2,3,4) given in this question, when properly sequenced, form a coherent paragraph. Each sentence is labelled with a number. Decide on the proper sequence of order of the sentences and key in this sequence of four numbers as your answer:1. They would rather do virtuous side projects assiduously as long as 
these would not compel them into doing their day jobs more honourably or
 reduce the profit margins.2. They would fund a million of the buzzwordy programs rather than 
fundamentally question the rules of their game or alter their own 
behavior to reduce the harm of the existing distorted, inefficient and 
unfair rules.3. Like the dieter who would rather do anything to lose weight than 
actually eat less, the business elite would save the world through 
social-impact-investing and philanthro-capitalism.4.  Doing the right thing — and moving away from their win-win mentality —
 would involve real sacrifice; instead, it’s easier to focus on their 
pet projects and initiatives.
