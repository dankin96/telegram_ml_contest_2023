FATAL: Caught exception: It appears that Fulcrum was forcefully killed in the middle of committing a block to the db. We cannot figure out where exactly in the update process Fulcrum was killed, so we cannot undo the inconsistent state caused by the unexpected shutdown. Sorry!

The database has been corrupted. Please delete the datadir and resynch to bitcoind.
