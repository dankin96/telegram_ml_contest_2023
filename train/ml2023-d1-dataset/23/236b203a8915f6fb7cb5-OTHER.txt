FT8 sends 77 information bits in 15-second cycles with 12.64 seconds of transmission time and 2.36 seconds of decode time for a user data rate of 6.09 bits/sec. Source encoding gives an effective throughput of about 5 words per minute. The required SNR in a 2500 Hz bandwidth is −21 dB, so the corresponding Eb/N0 is 10 log10(2500/6.09) = 26.1 dB greater, or −21 dB + 26.1 = 5.1 dB.[1] The mode requires the sending and receiving computers to be synchronised so, while manual time setting is possible, most users make use of automatic online time servers using NTP or by receiving broadcast time signals from the GPS to ensure their transmissions fall in the proper windows.
