US intelligence, including assessments based on information provided by Israel, warned the Biden administration of an increased risk of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the weeks leading up to the recent attack on southern Israel. The assessments, which were produced in September and October, indicated that Hamas was likely to escalate rocket attacks and that there was an increasing possibility of violence by the group. However, the assessments did not provide specific details about the scale and brutality of the attack that occurred on October 7. It is unclear if these assessments were shared with Israel. Middle Eastern allies also reportedly raised concerns with the US and Israeli officials about the growing anger among Palestinians and the buildup of Hamas weapons. Despite these warnings, the US and Israeli officials did not anticipate the magnitude of the attack. Some officials believe that Israel's failure to predict the attack was due to a lack of imagination and complacency about the threat posed by Hamas. The Biden administration and intelligence officials maintain that it is too soon to review the planning for the attack.
