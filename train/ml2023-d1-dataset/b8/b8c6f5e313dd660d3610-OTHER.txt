A woman walking alone in a lush, green forest clearing, sunlight filtering through the leaves and dappling her skin. She is wearing a flowing, white dress and has long, flowing hair. Her face is captured in a look of gentle wonder, a slight smile playing upon her lips as she trails behind a butterfly, caught up in nature's beauty. The image conveys a feeling of peace, solitude and connectedness with the natural world.
