                1. Write some unit tests

                2. Deploy to a local chain w/ truffle + ganache
                - https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started
                3. Next deploy your contract to a testnet like goerli
                - get free goerli test eth here https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/

                Now if all went well you can deploy to mainnet :)
