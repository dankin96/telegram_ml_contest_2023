5ber.eSIM card is a physical SIM card that complies with the GSMA standards that can store up to 15 eSIM profiles at the same time. This card can only be activated on Android devices. Once it is activated, it can switch between devices without any restrictions.

Just remember, the Standard version is limited to 2 free eSIM downloads. If you would like to download more than 2 eSIMs, you will have to purchase to get more. On the other hand, there are no restrictions for downloading eSIM profiles for the 5ber Premium card, so you wouldn't need to worry. It is up to you to see which one best suits you.
