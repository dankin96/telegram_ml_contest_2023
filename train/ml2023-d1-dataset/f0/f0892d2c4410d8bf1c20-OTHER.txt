Having thoroughly gone through the details of these discussion, it is pertinent to have both stablecoins come onboard on Dexter. 
Dexter is obviously a successful DEX and with just 3 pools (currently), it has amazed the ecosystem with so much TVL. We all wish to have a good bag of liquidity and expose to almost a 1% impermanent loss and thus, with stablecoins, this will be achieved. 
For bootstrap...
