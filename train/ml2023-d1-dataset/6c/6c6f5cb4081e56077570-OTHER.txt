This controversy is over the fact that I said that I would scroll through /latest/ from time to time, and I would report posts that I saw on there that clearly violated Twitterâ€™s TOS to Twitter ( Specifically, clearly lolicon art, and text / image posts that contained clear transphobia ) I probably did this to about half a dozen posts in total, which makes what is coming up all the more depressing.
