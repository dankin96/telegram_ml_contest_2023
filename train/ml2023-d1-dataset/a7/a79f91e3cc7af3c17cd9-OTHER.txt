Each character is framed as a logic low start bit, data bits, possibly a parity bit and one or more stop bits. In most applications the least significant data bit (the one on the left in this diagram) is transmitted first, but there are exceptions (such as the IBM 2741 printing terminal).

Start bit
The start bit signals to the receiver that a new character is coming.

Data bit
The next five to nine bits, depending on the code set employed, represent the character.

Parity bit
If a parity bit is used, it would be placed after all of the data bits.

The parity bit is a way for the receiving UART to tell if any data has changed during transmission.

Stop bit
The next one or two bits are always in the mark (logic high, i.e., '1') condition and called the stop bit(s). They signal to the receiver that the character is complete. Since the start bit is logic low (0) and the stop bit is logic high (1) there are always at least two guaranteed signal changes between characters.

If the line is held in the logic low condition for longer than a character time, this is a break condition that can be detected by the UART.
