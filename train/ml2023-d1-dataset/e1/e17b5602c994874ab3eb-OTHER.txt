Germany will evacuate citizens from Israel on Thursday and Friday, the country's Foreign Office announced Tuesday.

German airline Lufthansa will operate several special flights from Israel at the request of the Foreign Office. Citizens registered with the German crisis prevention list “ELEFAND“ will be informed Thursday morning about how to book tickets for the special flights with Lufthansa, the Foreign Office said.

It was unclear how many German citizens or dual nationals are currently in Israel.
