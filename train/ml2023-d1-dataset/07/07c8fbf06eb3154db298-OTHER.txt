Consider the way people receive you, and the impacts actions or stories of actions can have on your posterity.

The story of the 6 Million is an example, with that anyone portraying themselves as NS or fascist has already lost most people. It makes such terms utterly devoid of potential for rehabilitation in the minds of the masses in the current status quo.

This isn't a call for rebranding.

We have thought of ourselves for years now as purely revolutionary and esoteric. However, we need to ensure good public relations with those who we may one day need to lead. We must keep matters within the context most readily understood & accepted.

The man on the street doesn't need your esoteric Hitlerism to strike a blow.

The man on the street doesn't even need to know about the Merchants.

He needs to know the System is poisoning his family.

He needs to know the System is the enemy.

He needs to know to where to direct his righteous wrath.
