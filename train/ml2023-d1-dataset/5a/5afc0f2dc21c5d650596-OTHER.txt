Message from wireguard-2,1:

--
For FreeBSD < 12.1 only the userland implementation wireguard-go is
available.

For FreeBSD >= 12.1 we default to use the kernel module if_wg(4).

If you experience problems with it you can switch back to wireguard-go
by removing net/wireguard-kmod and making sure net/wireguard-go is
installed.
The userland tools wg-quick(8) and wg(8) try to use kernel support if
the kernel module is available and otherwise fall back to wireguard-go
automatically. Config files are fully compatible.
