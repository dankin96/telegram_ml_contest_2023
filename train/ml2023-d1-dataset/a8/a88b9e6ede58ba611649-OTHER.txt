New research from piracy tracking firm MUSO reveals a strong correlation between movie piracy and box office revenues. The study found that when pirated downloads peak or slow down, movie theater visits show a similar trend. The demand for films at the box office follows the interest in these titles on pirate sites, especially upon release. The research compared the daily piracy numbers of 98 film releases with their official revenues at the box office, showing a strong correlation with a Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient of 0.85. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and the magnitude of changes may differ between piracy volume and box office revenue. Additionally, the study analyzed the data for all films combined, potentially overlooking variations in smaller titles. Nonetheless, the overall conclusion aligns with the fact that people's interest in new releases tends to peak early and decline afterward. MUSO intends to use this finding to help rightsholders leverage piracy data to their advantage.
