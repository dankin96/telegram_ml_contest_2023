The article discusses the evolving tactics and techniques of Chinese nation-state threat actors. Due to the shift to remote work caused by COVID-19, threat actors have exploited system misconfigurations and vulnerabilities to access sensitive resources. Instead of desktop malware, they prioritize stealing passwords and tokens for remote access. One notable threat group, Nylon Typhoon, targets unpatched systems and uses credential dumpers to gain access to higher-value systems. Chinese nation-state groups have also shifted their focus to exploiting edge devices and maintaining persistence. Virtual private networks (VPNs) are a popular target, as compromising them eliminates the need for malware. Additionally, these threat actors use databases and conduct their own Internet scans to uncover vulnerabilities. Organizations need to implement stringent security measures, inventory their exposed devices, and establish granular logging capabilities to defend against these evolving threats.
