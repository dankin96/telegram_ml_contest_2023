The issue of "bad milk" in China has been a concern in the past, primarily due to a series of food safety scandals and incidents related to the production and distribution of milk and dairy products. Some of the key reasons behind these problems include:

    Lack of Regulation: Historically, China's regulatory framework for food safety has faced challenges in terms of enforcement and oversight, which has allowed some unscrupulous producers to engage in unsafe practices.

    Counterfeit Products: There have been cases of counterfeit milk products being produced and sold, which often do not meet quality and safety standards. These products can be harmful to consumers.

    Contamination: Some incidents involved contamination of milk with harmful substances such as melamine, which was added to milk to artificially boost its protein content. This led to severe health issues, particularly in infants.

    Weak Oversight: Inadequate supervision and inspection of dairy farms and processing facilities contributed to the problem. The lack of proper monitoring allowed substandard practices to persist.
