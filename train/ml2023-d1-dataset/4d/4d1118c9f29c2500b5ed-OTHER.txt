Cities are the more dangerous to live in, the more jobs are lost

People moved out of farms for the promise of better work in cities
Now that work is being significantly outsourced to AI and abroad - people are growing more desperate - many were already living paycheque to paycheque

The land is now costly to buy (and also to farm ) - and government lobbies are 
preventing affordable housing in many older-owned areas

Cities will turn violent unless a new social contract is brought in to share 
the resources from “needed” non-dominated workers

Unless we have UBI (which I hate the idea of) or the people who have food and shelter suddenly grow a heart of gold - we are heading somewhere very dark indeed.

There is not the gov funding to support the coming number of lost jobs
