Current changes:
- Unify terminology, import from RFC9234 and the ASPA draft;
  Expand definitions.
- Use peer only in the AS relationship context; Add mutual-upstream 
  relation.
- Add note on the (hypothetical) PMTUD attack.
- Clarify that IXPs decide whether their IXP LAN(s) should be 
  advertised; Removed IXP example in the Appendix.
- Noted additional IXP Lan cases (upstream via etc.) and next-hop 
  filtering
- Split between dynamic (IRR and down) and (semi) static filter 
  (bogons etc.) sources
- Add ASPA and BGP roles/OTC
- Note use of community-based filtering, also discussing leak-potential
  of static filters being used.
- Add large-communities/scrubbing
- Describe Rulesets more explicitly and in terms of ideal order for 
  more relationships
- Emphasize outbound filtering
- Suggest iBGP filtering (this may be a bridge too far)
- Add MAY for scrubbing of attributes
- Add note on ASPATH max-length filtering
- Reference RFC9319
- Add max-prefix limits and global limits
- Add considerations for filter implementation and generation/runtime

Todo:
- Unify terminology around route/prefix/NLRI, which is currently a bit
  mixed up.
- Add note on origin from RFC7454
