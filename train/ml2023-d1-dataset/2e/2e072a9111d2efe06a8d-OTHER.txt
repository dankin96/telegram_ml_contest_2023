TEA1 contains a secret reduction step that effectively downgrades the cryptographic strength from 80 to 32 bits, allowing anyone to break the cipher and subsequently decrypt the signal in as little as one minute using a consumer laptop. "There's no other way in which this can function than that this is an intentional backdoor," "This constitutes a full break of the cipher, allowing for interception or manipulation of radio traffic", according to the news report posted on ComputerWeekly.[7] The deliberately weakened TEA1 flaw seems to be known in intelligence circles and is referred to in the famous 2006 Wikileaks dump of US diplomatic communications
