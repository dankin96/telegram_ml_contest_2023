I feel like I'll have more fun playing supportive to my wife so she can just destroy everything I hope that's allowed. Once pally/knight/monk/ etc. Type class comes then I'll play what I really enjoy but right now it's more about getting my wife to enjoy the game and want to keep playing it. She loves seeing big numbers on the screen.
