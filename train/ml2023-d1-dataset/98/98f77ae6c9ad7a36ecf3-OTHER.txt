Should Entities Even Know About Domain Services?
In the previous example, you saw how domain events preclude injecting domain services
into entities, whereas each of the other patterns goes in the opposite direction and tries to
find a way to make the dependency feasible. The latter is a fairly contentious approach within
the DDD community; many practitioners argue that itâ€™s just a bad idea. Ultimately, you need
to use context, personal preferences, and your experience to decide which option you like the
best.
