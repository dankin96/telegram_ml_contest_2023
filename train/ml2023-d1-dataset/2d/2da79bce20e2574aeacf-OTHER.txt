Good evening. A few days ago I asked this group if 5g was working on the GSI's. The 5g icon was never shown to me in the notification bar. I did some testing to be sure and took some screenshots. NR-NSA appears in the Network Signal Guru app and in speed tests with 4g only and 5g enabled, the speeds of the 5g enabled are much higher. In this case, the 5g is working even though the icon does not change? Follow the prints and thank you for your help.
