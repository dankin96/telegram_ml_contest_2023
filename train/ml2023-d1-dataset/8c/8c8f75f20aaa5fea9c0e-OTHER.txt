Sayyidah Maymūnah bint Sa’d radhiyallāhu ‘anhā says: “I said: “O Nabī of Allāh, inform us regarding Al-Bayt al-Muqaddas (Al-Masjid Al-Aqsā)!” Nabi sallāllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said: “Go and perform Salāh there!”….”if you are unable to visit it and perform Salāh there, then (at least) send some oil to be used in its lamps”.” [Abū Dāwūd, 457]
