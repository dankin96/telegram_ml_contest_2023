Am 83 years游놊 old. I was in the KFC drive thru this morning. A young lady behind me started honking  blowing 游꿬游꿬游꿬at me because I had taken so much time in placing my order. She bad mouthed me. So when  l got to the first window, I paid for my order and hers too游땍. The cashier must have told her what I had done,  because as we moved on, she leaned out her window waving and thanking me for paying her bill. She probably felt bad and thought I had paid her游때游때游때 rudeness with kindnes. As I approached the cashier, I showed the server both receipts and took her food too. Now she has to go back to the end of the que to start all over again.  You don't blow your horn at me. I have been here long enough.
