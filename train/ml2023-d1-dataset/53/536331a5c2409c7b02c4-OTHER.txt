Thank you for your letter sent to our Bank.

Our foreign subsidiaries operate as a separate entity.

Although our foreign subsidiaries are part of the OTP Group, but they are entirely separate legal entities, and we do not have any special channels to contact them about matters pertaining to day-to-day banking activities.

Please kindly about the correct orientation for the services of the Russian subsidiary's customer service to ask for.

Thank you for your understanding.
