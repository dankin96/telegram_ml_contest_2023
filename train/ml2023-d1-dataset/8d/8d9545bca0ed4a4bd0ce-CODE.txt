# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'hello', True)

# Accessing elements in a tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: 'hello'

# Tuples are immutable, so you can't change individual elements
# This will result in an error:
# my_tuple[0] = 5

# You can, however, create a new tuple with modified elements
new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)
print(new_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'hello', True, 4, 5)
