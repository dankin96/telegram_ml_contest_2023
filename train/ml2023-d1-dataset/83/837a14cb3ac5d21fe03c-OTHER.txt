[information regarding "duped" usernames & more]

if it says (dupe) next to the username, then only 1 copy is available/for sale (of that username);

if it says (both copies), then both copies of the duped username are available/are for sale;

if it doesn't say anything, then the username is not duped and only 1 account with such username exists;

if you're buying a duped username, in order to make it available by visiting the URL on any browser/device, simply update its profile info once;

you're also able to link duped usernames to your discord profile;

the accounts are the safest on the market (no phone #s linked, no restrictions);
all of the bins are either firm or semi-firm;


in order to offer, send me a dm & fill the following form:
