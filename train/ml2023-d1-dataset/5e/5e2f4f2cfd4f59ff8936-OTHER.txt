Me(26) and my girlfriend(27) recently moved in with a friend Hannah (26) and her boyfriend Jake (22). We both share rooms and there is a third spare bedroom that is used as an office. We all agreed to split rent equally 4 ways. However, Hannah and Jake broke up a few months into the lease. Hannah moved out leaving Jake behind. We were understanding and renegotiated rent. Me and my girlfriend each paying 30% (60% total together)of rent leaving Jake to pay the remaining 40%. Everyone was happy with this for some time.Last week Jake told us he wants to move out and Hannah would like to move back in. We told Jake that we are fine with that but make sure Hannah is aware she is responsible for his entire rent. He said okay. Now, Hannah and Jake are insisting we pay rent evenly 3 ways when Hannah moves in. We voiced our side of the story that we are sharing a room and Hannah is not and we think the current decision of 30/30/40 is fair considering. They became hostile and passive aggressive after we voiced this. I then mentioned that we are open to splitting rent 3 ways if we get the second bedroom, however this means it is no longer communal and Hannah would have no rights to it. They got more angry and said we were being petty.
