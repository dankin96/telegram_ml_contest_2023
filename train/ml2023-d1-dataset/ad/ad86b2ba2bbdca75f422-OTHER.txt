I (21f) just found out my friend from school (15f) died in a car accident yesterday morning. She was flung from a car and hit a tree after the car rolled of the roadway. Prior to this news I agreed to join my family for my dads birthday dinner and it was too late to cancel. I went with my boyfriend and after having a panic attack in the car I didn’t feel like being super social, but I tried to put on a brave face for my siblings (17m and 12f). My mom could tell something was up so she pulled me into the kitchen to ask me what was wrong, so I broke down and told her about what happened. She hugged me but then said it was about my dad and to “get over it because crying won’t bring her back”. I walked out of the kitchen and stayed by my boyfriend the rest of the time we were at my parents, he could tell something was up so we left shortly after that. Now my mom and my grandma on my dads side are blowing up my phone saying I could have dealt with my emotions better. I know I could have stayed home, but that would have opened up a whole different fight that I wasn’t willing to go through. I thought I could hold it together, but my emotions got the better of me. I’m not looking for sympathy just honesty. So AITA?
