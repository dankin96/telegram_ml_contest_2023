In Korean, some questions and answers look the same.😜

The difference is in how we say the sentence.
- When asking questions, our tone rises at the end.💜💚
- When answering questions, our tone falls at the end.

Rising tone❤️‍🔥😁

잘 지냈어요? / Jal ji-nae-sseo-yo?
(Have you been well?)

Falling tone

네, 잘 지냈어요. / Ne, Jal ji-nae-seeo-yo.
(Yes, I have been well.)
