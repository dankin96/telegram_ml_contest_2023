The number of people working in URE (Unity Runtime and Editor... AKA the Unity tool you know) is ~950 (and that's including engineers, product manager, project managers, tech artists, etc). So what does everyone else do? ~2000 people working in ads (including iron source). ~1500 people in business development (working with teams to help develop their games, but there's a lot of enterprise using Unity for more than games, like car UI and what not). There's also the Weta digital team which is ~500 people making Weta's tools.
