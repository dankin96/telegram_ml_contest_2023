 I have been watching this stock for really long time. It does look like company isn’t going to get better anytime soon. Even Ceo said in the interview that Disney is in worse shape than he thought. Why are people still buying this stock? Is it solely because people are betting it’s going to turn around like meta? I’m bullish on Disney but I’m just going to wait until it goes below 70.
