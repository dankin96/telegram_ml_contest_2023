Audacious is opening whenever a drive is added; seems to be a known issue; happens on every system after setting folders to be opened by Audacious. ~ mount - Why opening a folder via a shortcut makes Audacious to start? - Ask Ubuntu 
Dolphin is also having issues removing drives; takes a really long time; closing the window seems to speed it up so could be a memory leak issue. 
Much appreciated.
