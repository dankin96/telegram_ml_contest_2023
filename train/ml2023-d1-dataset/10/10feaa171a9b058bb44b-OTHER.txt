 How exactly did fredbear manage to jumpscare me here, while I was holding the door closed? This has happened to me multiple times. Also, the screeching audio in the back is not there in game. It obviously is the sound of the Freddie's screaming as if I was on night 1-4, but it's night 5 so no Freddies. I'm wearing headphones and that sound is NOT playing whole I'm playing the game, only on the screen recording, so I'm not sure if it's a glitch or if it's some anti-screen recording thing(why would they not want you to screen record?)
