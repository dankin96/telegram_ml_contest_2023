For your reference, please read the following 10 points concerning makeup exam from Article 87 of AAU Senate legislation. 

👉🏿 A student unable to sit for a final examination for reasons beyond his control, such as hospitalization, psychological problems or other accidents, and therefore has an "I" (incomplete) grade in a module/course may be allowed to sit for a make-up examination in the module/course.

👉🏿 Any such student, or a person representing the student, shall submit application for make-up examination in writing with valid and documented reasons for not having sat for the final examination to the chair/head of his academic department/center/school within six weeks after the start of the subsequent semester.

👉🏿 Where the AC finds that the student did not have valid reasons for not sitting for a final examination, the "I" grade on the student's record shall be automatically changed to "F". GPAs shall be calculated and the status of the student shall be determined accordingly.

👉🏿 The department/center chair or school head will decide the examination date in consultation with the student/s. Such date may range from six weeks to a year from the date a decision by AC was made. The chair/head of the academic unit offering the module/course shall immediately inform the instructor concerned of the AC's decisions on applications for make-up examination in writing so that the instructor may set a different set of examination questions for the student if he feels that there has been change in the content, in the mode of delivery or in module/course activity after the semester in which the student has attended the module/ course.

👉🏿 A student allowed to sit for a make-up examination shall register for the examination at least one month (the dates to be announced by the Office of the Registrar) before the final examination in the module/course is scheduled to be administered.

👉🏿 A student who has three or more "I" grades in a semester and would therefore sit for a make-up examination shall, irrespective of his academic status, withdraw from the University for academic reasons and apply for make-up examination as in sub-Article 87.5 hereof. No GPAs shall be calculated and no academic status shall be determined for such a student until the results of the make-up examination are known.

👉🏿 A student who has less than three (one or two) "I" grades in a semester and who is allowed to take a make-up examination may continue his studies in subsequent semester if he is in good academic standing (Semester GPA greater than 1.75 and CGPA greater than 2.00). For such a student, GPA shall be calculated and his academic status shall be determined based on the grades obtained and excluding courses in which the "I" grades are registered. Such a student shall also apply and sit for a make-up examination in incomplete courses as in sub-Article 87.5 hereof.

👉🏿 For a student who has less than three "I" grades but is not in good academic standing, the procedure in sub-Article 89.5 hereof shall apply. The grade earned through the make-up examination shall be used to compute the GPA of the student in the semester in which the makeup examination is given.

👉🏿 Unless otherwise decided by the AVP, any “I” grade not removed within a year as per the provisions of this Article shall be converted to an “F” grade.

👉🏿 The provisions of sub-Articles 87.4 through 87.7 hereof shall not apply for clinical courses in the School of Medicine.
