She'll make you off
the rain
make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like bullet to your brain

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin' la vida loca
